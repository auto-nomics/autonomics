//! `NodeRegion` — the safe, clipped writer custom node painters draw
//! through.
//!
//! A node declares an area (`width × height`); layout routes edges
//! around it; at render time a painter fills it. `NodeRegion` is the
//! painter's only pen: coordinates are **node-local** (`(0, 0)` is the
//! node's top-left), and every write outside the declared area — or
//! outside the band currently being composited — is a silent no-op.
//! Escaping the region is structurally impossible at the **canvas**
//! level: painters need no `unsafe` and cannot write to neighboring
//! cells. That isolation is per logical cell — control characters,
//! escape sequences, combining marks, and wide glyphs can still affect
//! terminal output beyond one cell, exactly as they can in node labels
//! (the engine passes text through untranslated; validating painter
//! text is the caller's concern, same as label text today).
//!
//! Banding note: a node spanning a band boundary is replayed once per
//! band; the painter runs again with identical inputs and the canvas
//! clips rows outside the current band. Determinism under replay —
//! drawing the same content each call — is therefore a **documented
//! caller contract**: a plain `fn` cannot capture locals, but it can
//! still read global state, panic (propagating to the render caller),
//! or vary per call, none of which the type system prevents. Use
//! [`NodePaintCtx::visible_rows`] to skip content outside the current
//! band — tall nodes replay per band, and re-drawing everything each
//! time is wasted work (clipping keeps it *correct* either way).
