//! Composable crossing reduction pipeline.
//!
//! Provides configurable strategies for minimising edge crossings in
//! hierarchical (Sugiyama-style) layouts.  Inspired by zigraph's
//! composable pipeline design.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! A [`CrossingReducer`] is a single strategy (e.g. median heuristic or
//! adjacent-exchange refinement).  A *pipeline* is a slice of reducers
//! that are applied in sequence — each one refines the ordering left by
//! the previous one.
//!
//! Three pre-built pipelines are shipped as constants:
//!
//! | Preset      | Pipeline                                         |
//! |-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
//! | [`FAST`]    | `Median(2)`                                      |
//! | [`STANDARD`]| `Median(4) → AdjacentExchange(2)`                |
//! | [`QUALITY`] | `Median(8) → AdjacentExchange(4) → Median(2)`   |
