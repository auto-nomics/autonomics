//! Core graph data structure.
//!
//! This module provides the fundamental graph structure with nodes and edges.
//! The primary type is `Graph` (feature `alloc`).
//!
//! ## Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - **Node/Edge Insertion**: O(1) amortized with HashMap and cached adjacency lists
//! - **Child/Parent Lookups**: O(1) via cached adjacency lists (not O(E) iteration)
//! - **ID→Index Mapping**: O(1) via HashMap (not O(N) scan)
//! - **Node Width**: O(1) via pre-computed cache
//!
//! ## Memory Overhead
//!
//! Per node:
//! - ~100 bytes (node data, caches, adjacency list headers)
//!
//! Per edge:
//! - ~16 bytes (adjacency list entries, both directions)
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! - No unsafe code
//! - For untrusted input, consider limiting maximum nodes/edges to prevent resource exhaustion
//! - Maximum node ID: `usize::MAX` (up to 20 decimal digits)
