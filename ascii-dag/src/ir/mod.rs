//! Intermediate Representation for graph layout.
//!
//! This module provides a renderer-agnostic representation of a laid-out graph.
//! The IR captures the computed positions, dimensions, and edge routing information
//! that can be consumed by various renderers (ASCII, ANSI colors, SVG, HTML, etc.).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! DAG → [Layout Algorithm] → LayoutIR → [Renderer] → Output
//!                                           │

//!                               ASCII/ANSI       SVG/HTML
//! ```
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use ascii_dag::Graph;
//!
//! let dag = Graph::from_edges(

//!     &[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
//! );
//!
//! // Get the intermediate representation
//! let ir = dag.compute_layout();
//!
//! // Inspect layout information
//! println!("Levels: {}", ir.level_count());
//! println!("Total width: {}", ir.width());
//! println!("Total height: {}", ir.height());
