//! The public cell vocabulary — decoded views over the composed
//! canvas.
//!
//! [`SceneComposer::visit_cells`](super::composer::SceneComposer::visit_cells)
//! yields one [`CellView`] per canvas cell: what the cell **means**
//! (per-arm stroke weights, marker kind and direction, a text char —
//! never a pre-decoded glyph or the packed internal representation),
//! its resolved color, and its hit/pick owner. Unicode and ASCII
//! terminal output are two projections of exactly this vocabulary; an
//! SVG or TUI consumer projects it however it likes.
