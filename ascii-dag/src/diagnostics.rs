//! Typed, run-scoped diagnostics.
//!
//! Fatal failures stay in `Result<T, E>` — an `Err` is authoritative
//! and never copied here. Everything NON-fatal the library wants to
//! tell you (a placeholder was auto-created, a label had nowhere to
//! go) travels as typed data through one narrow channel:
//!
//! - a [`Diagnostic`] is an owned, lifetime-free record with a stable
//!   machine code, a severity, and a semantic [`DiagnosticKind`] whose
//!   subjects use USER-FACING identity (node ids, input edge indices —
//!   never scene positions);
//! - a [`DiagnosticSink`] decides storage: collect ([`VecDiagnostics`],
//!   [`SliceDiagnostics`]), count ([`CountingDiagnostics`]), forward
//!   ([`FnDiagnostics`]), or explicitly discard
//!   ([`IgnoreDiagnostics`]) — the library never selects stderr;
//! - a [`DiagnosticRun`] owns one sink for one logical operation run,
//!   lends [`DiagnosticContext`]s to context-taking entry points, and
//!   [`finish`](DiagnosticRun::finish)es into a [`Report`] pairing the
//!   outcome with everything collected.
//!
//! Emission is best-effort and can never fail an operation: a bounded
//! sink that fills up counts what it dropped, and storage exhaustion
//! never turns a warning into an unrelated failure. Diagnostics are
//! deterministic public output: both layout backends emit the same
//! codes, subjects, and order for the same graph.
//!
//! The compatibility promise: existing codes are never repurposed and
//! never change severity or subject meaning; new kinds and codes are
//! additive; match on [`DiagnosticKind`] non-exhaustively.
