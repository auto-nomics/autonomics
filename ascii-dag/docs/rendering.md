# Rendering

How to change the *look* of a graph, get the output into wherever it
needs to go, and answer "what did the user just click on".

For the *shape* — direction, spacing, clusters — see
[layout.md](layout.md).

## Output surfaces

These exist on both IR types (`LayoutIR` from the heap pipeline,
`LayoutIRArena` from the arena one), so the choice of *pipeline* never
changes how you render. What does change things is the `alloc`
feature: the convenience surfaces need somewhere to put their result.

| You want | Use | Needs `alloc` |
|---|---|:---:|
| A `String` | `render_string(&options)` | yes |
| To write into something | `render_with(&options, &mut writer)` | yes |
| Bytes, into your buffer | `render_to_bytes(&options, &arena, &mut buf)` | no |
| To inspect, not paint | `ScenePlanner::new().plan(&ir, &options.plan).quiet()` | yes |
| …the same, no-alloc | `ScenePlanner::new_in(&mut workspace)` | no |
| What is at this cell | `scene.hit_test(x, y)` | no |
| Repeated renders of one scene | `TerminalRenderer::new(&emit, req)` + `render(&scene, &mut out)` | no (`new_in`) |

On a build with
`default-features = false, features = ["arena", "layout-vertical"]`
(or `layout-horizontal` instead),
`render_to_bytes` and the `new_in` planner are what you have — which
is the whole no-allocation story, just spelled explicitly.

```rust
use ascii_dag::{Graph, RenderOptions};

let g = Graph::from_edges(&[(1, "A"), (2, "B")], &[(1, 2)]);
let ir = g.compute_layout();
print!("{}", ir.render_string(&RenderOptions::plain()));
```

## Options

Options live in three homes by what they affect: `plan` holds
everything that changes resolved semantics, `emit` holds how those
semantics are written, and `compose` holds memory knobs that never
affect output.

```rust
let mut options = RenderOptions::plain();
options.emit.charset = ascii_dag::Charset::Ascii;
options.plan.label_policy.overflow = ascii_dag::LabelOverflow::Legend;
options.emit.render_legend = true;
options.compose.band_rows_cap = 32;
```

| Field | Values | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `emit.charset` | `Unicode` / `Ascii` | `Unicode` | Equal projections of one canvas — `Ascii` swaps `┌─│→` for `+-\|>` |
| `emit.color_mode` | `None` / `Ansi256` / `TrueColor` | `None` | ANSI escapes for edge coloring |
| `emit.render_legend` | `bool` | `false` | Print the legend block after the diagram |
| `plan.palette` | `Palette::*` | `Ansi` | Which colors the edge coloring draws from |
| `plan.label_policy.placement` | `Geometric` / `AvoidNodeRows` | `Geometric` | Whether inline labels may sit on rows hosting nodes |
| `plan.label_policy.overflow` | `Omit` / `Legend` | `Omit` | Where labels that found no inline position go |
| `plan.show_dummy_nodes` | `bool` | `false` | Draw `◍` at routing waypoints (see [layout.md](layout.md#routing-waypoints)) |
| `plan.edge_style_fn` etc. | `fn` pointers | legacy look | Per-element styling, below |
| `compose.band_rows_cap` | `usize` | `64` | Canvas memory ceiling — see [banding](#banding-and-memory) |

Four `const` presets cover the common combinations:
`RenderOptions::plain()`, `::colored(palette)`, `::ascii()`,
`::ascii_colored(palette)`.

Pick `Ascii` when the destination cannot render box-drawing glyphs —
a log aggregator, a CI annotation, a small embedded font. Both
charsets decode the same semantic canvas, so topology, junctions and
arrow directions all survive. ASCII has fewer glyphs to spend, so some
distinctions collapse: light, dashed and double verticals all become
`|`, and mixed-weight junctions become `+`. The graph is still
correct; it is just less expressive.

## Labels and the legend

Edge labels are placed according to `plan.label_policy`. When a label
cannot be placed inline, the default plain/ASCII policy omits it and
diagnostic-aware planning reports the omission. To collect overflow in
the legend and actually print that block:

```rust
let mut options = RenderOptions::plain();
options.plan.label_policy.overflow = ascii_dag::LabelOverflow::Legend;
options.emit.render_legend = true;
```

```text
Edge labels:
Client → Gateway: "http"
Users → DB: "read"
```

The legend works in colored *and* plain output. In color, entries are
tinted to match their edge; in plain they are self-keying, since each
line names both endpoints. It is off in `plain()`/`ascii()` and on in
`colored(palette)`/`ascii_colored(palette)`. The colored presets also use
`AvoidNodeRows` placement. Collecting overflow and emitting the legend
are separate choices; setting `emit.render_legend` alone does not
change the plan's label slots.

The one-shot render methods discard planning diagnostics. If missing
labels matter to your application, use the
[diagnostic-aware scene recipe](diagnostics.md#layout-planning-and-rendering-in-one-report).

## Styling

Three plain `fn` pointers, resolved once per element at plan time —
never per cell. Being `fn` rather than a closure keeps them
`no_std`-safe and `Copy`.

### Edges

```rust
use ascii_dag::render::engine::{EdgeStyle, EdgeStyleCtx, LineWeight, MarkerShape};

fn dashed_back_edges(ctx: EdgeStyleCtx<'_>) -> EdgeStyle {
    EdgeStyle {
        weight: Some(if ctx.reversed { LineWeight::Dashed } else { LineWeight::Light }),
        marker_end: MarkerShape::Arrow,
        ..EdgeStyle::default()
    }
}

let mut options = RenderOptions::plain();
options.plan.edge_style_fn = dashed_back_edges;
```

`EdgeStyleCtx` carries the edge index, both endpoint ids, the label,
and whether the edge is directed or was reversed during cycle
breaking — enough to color by endpoint, weight by semantic, or
suppress arrowheads on undirected graphs.

`MarkerShape::None` on `marker_end` removes the arrowhead;
`marker_start: MarkerShape::Arrow` gives you a double-headed edge.

### Subgraph styling

```rust
use ascii_dag::render::engine::{LabelPosition, SubgraphBorder, SubgraphStyle, SubgraphStyleCtx};

fn light_boxes(_ctx: SubgraphStyleCtx<'_>) -> SubgraphStyle {
    SubgraphStyle {
        border: SubgraphBorder::Light,
        label_pos: LabelPosition::InsideBottom,
        ..SubgraphStyle::default()
    }
}
```

`SubgraphBorder::None` groups nodes without drawing any box — the
label still paints, and the cluster still affects layout. Useful when
you want the grouping to influence placement without the visual
weight.

### Edge labels

`edge_label_style_fn` takes the same `EdgeStyleCtx` and returns an
`EdgeLabelStyle`, so a label can be colored independently of its edge.

## Streaming

`render_with` writes into any `core::fmt::Write` and never builds the
whole string:

```rust
let mut out = String::new();
ir.render_with(&options, &mut out)?;
```

Rendering is banded, so this genuinely streams: a band is composited,
emitted, and its buffer reused. **Peak canvas memory is one band**,
not one canvas, however tall the graph is. (The render plan is
separate and stays proportional to nodes and edges.)

`render_with` takes a `core::fmt::Write`, which is *not* the same
trait as `std::io::Write` — there is no standard adapter between them.
For a socket or file, either write a four-line shim:

```rust
struct IoSink<W>(W);

impl<W: std::io::Write> core::fmt::Write for IoSink<W> {
    fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) -> core::fmt::Result {
        self.0.write_all(s.as_bytes()).map_err(|_| core::fmt::Error)
    }
}
```

…or render to bytes and hand them over with `io::Write::write_all`.

## No-allocation rendering

The arena path never allocates. Size the two buffers from the IR, hand
them over, and you get bytes back:

```rust
use ascii_dag::graph::arena::Arena;

let mut arena_buf = vec![0u8; ir.estimate_render_arena_size(&options)];
let arena = Arena::new(&mut arena_buf);
let mut out = vec![0u8; ir.estimate_render_output_size(&options)];

let written = ir.render_to_bytes(&options, &arena, &mut out)?;
let text = core::str::from_utf8(&out[..written]).unwrap();
```

Both estimates are upper bounds — an exactly-sized buffer always
suffices, which is what lets you provision statically on a
microcontroller. Undersized buffers do not panic; they return
`RenderPlanOom`, `RenderCanvasTooSmall`, or `RenderOutputTooSmall`,
each with a hint naming what to grow.

On a target with no allocator at all, the buffers are plain arrays:

```rust
let mut arena_buf = [0u8; 4096];
let mut out = [0u8; 2048];
```

`examples/lean_render.rs` carves the graph, the layout, and the render
out of one fixed 16 KB block — nothing allocates, and the layout's
scratch memory is reused for rendering. `examples/longan_nano` does
the same on a 32 KB RISC-V board.

## Banding and memory

The renderer composites in horizontal bands. `band_rows_cap` caps the
band height, so canvas memory is `width × min(cap, height)` cells
regardless of how tall the graph is — a 50,000-node fan renders in
bounded memory.

Output is byte-identical at every cap; the setting trades a little
per-band overhead against peak memory, and 64 (the default) is a good
balance. Lower it on memory-constrained targets.

## Hit-testing (interactive and IDE consumers)

A `Scene` gives you the renderer's own geometry without painting
anything: a `ScenePlanner` resolves the layout once (styles run
exactly once), and `hit_test` answers what occupies a cell. The scene
borrows both the planner and the layout, so a stale plan/layout
pairing is a compile error:

```rust
use ascii_dag::render::engine::HitResult;
use ascii_dag::ScenePlanner;

let mut planner = ScenePlanner::new();
let scene = planner.plan(&ir, &options.plan).quiet()?;
match scene.hit_test(x, y) {
    HitResult::Node(id) => println!("node {id}"),
    HitResult::Edge(index) => println!("edge #{index}"),
    HitResult::Subgraph(id) => println!("cluster {id}"),
    HitResult::None => {}
    _ => {}
}
```

This is what an editor plugin, TUI, or web terminal needs to make a
rendered graph clickable: translate a click to a cell (subtract your
own origin, account for scroll), then ask the scene.

The semantics are deliberately hybrid, because that is what feels
right under a cursor:

- **Nodes** hit as their full reserved rectangle, so a custom painter's
  whole area belongs to the node.
- **Self-loops** own their `↺` marker cell — clicking it selects the
  loop edge (`HitResult::Edge` of its scene index), not the node.
- **Edges** hit as *painted ink* — the exact cells the compositor drew,
  not a bounding box, so two crossing edges resolve correctly. A
  painted edge label belongs to its edge.
- **Bordered clusters** own their complete rectangle — border, label,
  and blank interior alike (clicking inside a box selects it); a
  borderless cluster (`SubgraphBorder::None`) has only its label cells
  to hit.

Nodes win over edges, edges over clusters — the visual z-order.

A scene is bound to the layout it was planned from — it borrows both
its planner and the layout, so a stale pairing is a compile error
rather than a runtime surprise. A query outside its canvas returns
`HitResult::None` rather than panicking. Re-plan when the layout
changes; a scene is a snapshot, not a live view.

`Scene` also exposes `width`, `height`, and `legend_entries` for
laying out a viewport around the graph.

## Beyond the terminal (`SceneComposer`)

Terminal strings are one projection of the composed canvas. A
`SceneComposer` hands you the canvas itself — one `CellView` per cell,
row-major — for SVG writers, TUI buffers, or interactive pickers:

```rust
use ascii_dag::SceneComposer;

let req = scene.composition_requirements(&options.compose);
let mut composer = SceneComposer::new(req);
composer.visit_cells(&scene, |x, y, cell| {
    // cell.kind:  Empty / Text / Stroke { per-arm weights } / Marker
    // cell.color: resolved color, whatever the emission mode
    // cell.owner: what hit_test reports for this cell
})?;
```

Stroke cells carry per-arm weights instead of pre-picked glyphs —
Unicode and ASCII terminal output are two projections of this same
vocabulary, and an SVG consumer can draw real vector strokes from it.
`try_visit_cells` is the early-exit form for fallible sinks. The
composer retains its workspace: steady-state repaint allocates
nothing, and `SceneComposer::new_in` composes out of a caller-provided
byte slice for no-alloc targets.

### Retain cells and reuse the scene

This complete default-feature example keeps a small semantic buffer
without invoking a terminal emitter. Copy the fields you need:
`CellView` itself is callback-scoped. `owner` is the hit-test owner,
not paint provenance; even a blank cell inside a node can have an owner.

```rust
use ascii_dag::{
    BoxedNode, CellColor, CellKind, Graph, HitResult, PortSide,
    RenderOptions, SceneComposer, ScenePlanner,
};

let mut graph = Graph::new();
graph.add_node(1, BoxedNode("Hub"));
graph.add_node(2, "A");
graph.add_node(3, "B");
graph.add_edge(1, 2, None).from_port(PortSide::East);
graph.add_edge(1, 3, None);
let ir = graph.compute_layout();
let options = RenderOptions::plain();
let mut planner = ScenePlanner::new();
let scene = planner.plan(&ir, &options.plan).quiet().expect("plan");
let mut composer = SceneComposer::new(scene.composition_requirements(&options.compose));
let width = scene.width();
let cell_count = width.checked_mul(scene.height()).expect("canvas too large");
let mut cells = vec![(CellKind::Empty, CellColor::DEFAULT, HitResult::None); cell_count];

for _ in 0..2 {
    let mut next = 0;
    composer.visit_cells(&scene, |x, y, cell| {
        let index = y * width + x;
        assert_eq!(index, next); // row-major, including empty cells
        // An integration-test check; a UI normally just uses cell.owner.
        assert_eq!(cell.owner, scene.hit_test(x, y));
        cells[index] = (cell.kind, cell.color, cell.owner);
        next += 1;
    }).expect("compose");
    assert_eq!(next, cell_count);
}
```

The buffer is an application choice and costs one full canvas; it is
not required by the composer. A memory-constrained consumer can forward
each cell to a device or process a viewport instead of retaining all
cells. The composer still visits the full scene; filtering a viewport
in the callback reduces what you store, not what it composes.

This example deliberately discards diagnostics for brevity. To inspect
port fallbacks as well as label omissions, use one run for layout and
planning as shown in [diagnostics.md](diagnostics.md). The
[SVG example](../examples/svg_export.rs) is a different integration:
it reads element views, not `SceneComposer` cells.

### No-alloc sizing (three contracts)

Every retained buffer in the scene pipeline has its own estimator, and
each is pinned by exact-size tests — a buffer of precisely the
estimated size always suffices:

| Buffer | Sized by | Handed to |
|---|---|---|
| Scene storage | `ir.estimate_scene_size(&plan_options)` | `ScenePlanner::new_in` |
| Composition workspace | `req.workspace_bytes()` (semantic) / `req.terminal_workspace_bytes(&emit)` (terminal) | `SceneComposer::new_in` / `TerminalRenderer::new_in` |
| Output bytes | `scene.estimate_output_size(&emit)` | your buffer |

The two workspace-byte methods on `req` return `Option<usize>`:
`None` means the requirement overflowed and cannot be provisioned; it
does not mean zero workspace. A terminal-only consumer needs the lean
terminal workspace, not the semantic ownership workspace as well.

Given caller-provisioned buffers sized by the table, this retained
terminal path needs no allocator (enable `arena` and at least one axis):

```rust
use ascii_dag::{GraphError, RenderOptions, ScenePlanner, TerminalRenderer};
use ascii_dag::ir::arena::LayoutIRArena;

fn render_fixed(
    ir: &LayoutIRArena<'_>,
    options: &RenderOptions,
    scene_storage: &mut [u8],
    composition_storage: &mut [u8],
    output: &mut [u8],
) -> Result<usize, GraphError> {
    let mut planner = ScenePlanner::new_in(scene_storage);
    let scene = planner.plan(ir, &options.plan).quiet()?;
    let requirements = scene.composition_requirements(&options.compose);
    let mut renderer = TerminalRenderer::new_in(
        &options.emit, requirements, composition_storage,
    )?;
    renderer.render_into(&scene, output)?;
    // Same scene and buffers: no replanning or workspace allocation.
    renderer.render_into(&scene, output)
}
```

For semantic cells instead, construct
`SceneComposer::new_in(req, composition_storage)?`, sizing that slice
with `req.workspace_bytes()`. No encoded output buffer is required
unless your consumer needs one. Scene storage lives as long as the
scene; composition storage lives as long as its composer/renderer.

(`req` is `scene.composition_requirements(&budget)`. The one-shot
`render_to_bytes` keeps its combined
`estimate_render_arena_size`/`estimate_render_output_size` pair — it
plans and composes in a single arena.)

See `examples/hit_test.rs` for a working terminal program — it enables
xterm mouse reporting with raw escape sequences and no dependencies,
and `--probe X Y` makes it scriptable.

## Rendering someone else's IR

Nothing above requires the layout to have come from this crate's
pipeline. `LayoutIRBuilder` builds an IR by hand, and every render
surface accepts it — useful if you have your own positions and just
want the painter.
